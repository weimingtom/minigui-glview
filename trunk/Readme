MiniGUI GLView includes three separated parts of work:
	1. External control of MiniGUI (http://www.minigui.org), 
	   named GLView. GLView embedded a third party software 
	   renderer, TinyGL(http://bellard.org/TinyGL), which is a
	   subset of OpenGL(http://www.opengl.org). GLView provides
	   some basic but fast and lightweight rendering 
	   algorithms (powered by TinyGL) as well as keyboard and mouse
	   interactive controlls (powered by MiniGUI).
	2. Modified copy of TinyGL. New functions included:
		a. Offseted block copying for direct-screen-access
		   (from TinyGL internal buffer to screen framebuffer);
		b. Pixel line copying which supports non-4-bytes alignment
	3. Three rendering examples from official TinyGL examples with
	   minimum changes.
