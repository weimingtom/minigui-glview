program	: MiniGLView with TinyGL under MiniGUI
author	: Wei (David) Wu
E-mail	: KyosukeNo1@gmail.com


MiniGLView includes three separated parts of work:
	1. External control of MiniGUI (http://www.minigui.org), 
	   named GLView. MiniGLView embedded a third party software 
	   renderer, TinyGL(http://bellard.org/TinyGL), which is a
	   subset of OpenGL(http://www.opengl.org). MiniGLView provides
	   some basic but fast and lightweight rendering 
	   algorithms (powered by TinyGL) as well as keyboard and mouse
	   interactive controlls (powered by MiniGUI).
	2. Modified copy of TinyGL. New functions included:
		a. Offseted block copying for direct-screen-access
		   (from TinyGL internal buffer to screen framebuffer);
		b. Pixel line copying which supports non-4-bytes alignment
	3. Three rendering examples from official TinyGL examples with
	   minimum changes.

Folders within TinyGL:
	1. Folder: deprecated
		Deprecated files which came from original package, but not
		included in current redistribution. They can be used as code
		base for new platforms.
	2. Folder: include
		Include header files for normal users (external usages). For the
		users of TinyGL library, the files within include folder are the
		only files that they need to care about.
	3. Folder: src
		TinyGL software renderer engine code as well as the header files
		only used for engine internal functions.
		

Change list for TinyGL:
	1. zbuffer.h & zbuffer.c
		ZB_copyFrameBufferRGB32_OneLine:
			Line based pixel copying function for 32-bit (RGBA) color
		ZB_copyFrameBufferRGB24_OneLine:
			Line based pixel copying function for 24-bit (RGB) color
		ZB_copyFrameBufferWithOffset:
			Pixel data block copying function with x, y offsets.
